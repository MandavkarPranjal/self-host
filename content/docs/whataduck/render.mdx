import { RenderDeploy } from '@/components/ui/render-deploy';

Deploying on Render is quick and easy as it gives [Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/iac/) support.

Just click the deploy button below to get your WhataDuck instance up and running on Render.
<RenderDeploy
  repositoryUrl="https://github.com/MandavkarPranjal/whataduck"
/>
that's it!

by default, auto-sync is enabled, so if you want to disable it, you can do it in the settings of your Render dashboard.

If you want to do it manually, then remember the following settings:

**Build Command:**
```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile; pnpm run build
```

**Publish Directory:**
`dist`
