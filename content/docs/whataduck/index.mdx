description: Self-hosting your own instance of WhataDuck
---

WhataDuck is open-source and freely available for anyone to host themselves and use. It is under the MIT license. Essentially, self-hosting WhataDuck means you run or purchase your own infrastructure, manage deployments, choose your own URLs to expose it on and dealing with any scaling issues yourself (I believe you don't have to deal with it).

The self-hosted version of WhataDuck is the same exact codebase as the hosted version, but it's hosted on your own infrastructure. You can run it on your own server, or you can use a service like [Vercel](https://vercel.com) or [Render](https://render.com).

    I've hosted [WhataDuck](https://whataduck.pr5.dev) on Vercel's free tier.
