I don't know many providers, but whichever provider you are using, but here are the general steps to deploy WhataDuck on any other provider:

<Steps>
    <Step>
        Fork the repository:
        [Create a fork](https://github.com/MandavkarPranjal/whataduck/fork)
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Create a new Project on your chosen provider
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Select WhataDuck repo & click on Deploy
    </Step>
</Steps>
